# PRODIGY_ML_02
# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm applied to customer segmentation in a retail store. The algorithm groups customers based on their annual income and spending score.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Customer Segmentation Tutorial in Python](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python). Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the provided example in a notebook)
- Dependencies: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the project directory.
2. Run the `customer_segmentation.ipynb` notebook or use the provided Python script.

## Code Structure

- `customer_segmentation.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the K-means clustering algorithm and visualization.
- `customer_segmentation.py`: Python script equivalent to the notebook.

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook/script.

## Results

The algorithm will determine clusters of customers based on their annual income and spending score. The results will be visualized, showing the clusters and centroids.
